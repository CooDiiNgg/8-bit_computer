This is only temporary and will be replaced with a more complete version.
Note that the actual implementation of the 8-bit register will probably be compete beore the 8-bit register scheme is finished.
This is because the general idea and the basic functionality of the 8-bit register is already clear and can be implemented...
also, the parts are already available.
